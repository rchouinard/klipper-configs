My Klipper Configuration
========================

These settings are tuned to my specific printer, but hopefully they can be of use to others.

My Printer
----------

Ender-3 Pro with the following modifications:

 - [BTT SKR Mini E3 v3.0 control board][1]
 - [Creality Dual Z-Axis][2]
 - [Creality Sprite Pro Extruder][3]
 - [BLTouch Sensor][4]

I also use a Raspberry Pi 4 running [MainsailOS][5] connected to the controller via USB. The Raspberry Pi is also configured as a [secondary MCU][6].
